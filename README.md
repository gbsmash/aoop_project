This project is developed in Java programming language and aimed to determine the best way to distribute a group of 40 students among various study abroad destinations for a single semester. 
To achieve this, the project will employ a client-server architecture with the aid of multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
The client will consist of a GUI frame that allows students to input their preferences for destinations.
The allocation is then performed using the Genetic Algorithm.

Used Technologies : Java, client-server architecture, Genetic Algorithm, Java Networking (Sockets), Java Streams and Serialization, Graphical User Interface (GUI).
